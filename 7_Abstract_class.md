- A partially implemented class can be termed as an abstract class. By partially implemented, we mean that it can have abstract methods or methods with dummy implementation
- It is not possible to create objects for abstract class
- If a class contains at least one abstract method, then the class needs to be declared as abstract
- Even if a class doesn't have any abstract methods, it can be declared as abstract
